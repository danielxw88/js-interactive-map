# 🍽️ **Top Rated Food Places in Toronto - Interactive Map**

## 📌 **Project Purpose**
This project is designed to help **tourists, locals, and food enthusiasts** discover **top-rated, affordable food spots** in Toronto. The interactive map allows users to search, filter, and navigate food places by preferences like cuisine type, price range, and real-time data, solving the problem of **indecisiveness** and enhancing the user experience.

What makes it unique? 🎯  
Our map integrates **dynamic insights** with an interactive, visually appealing interface, ensuring it’s more user-friendly and engaging than tools like Google Maps or Yelp.
